# ASSEMBLY PRIMER
'''
Assembly is a low-level programming language.
Work directly with registers, interupts and memory.
Each line(usually) translates to one processor instruction.
Different processors use different assembly languages.
'''


# SYSCALLS
'''
Every native API call has a specific number that represents it(syscall).
Syscall number differ between different version of Windows(like 32bits and 64 bits).
Numbers can be verified with a debugger, or just use public lists.
To make a syscall, we need to use the INT instruction and move the number to a register.
in x64, the syscall instruction will then enter kernel mode.
